# -Predication-and-deployment-of-adult-dataset-using-classification-and-flask
Introduction:
 The adult income dataset that involves predicting personal income levels as above or below 50,000 per year based on personal details such as relationship and education level. This means that techniques for imbalanced classification can be used whilst model performance can still be reported using classification accuracy, as is used with balanced classification problems.

Approach:
In this, you will discover how to develop and evaluate a model for the imbalanced adult income classification dataset.
We evaluate:
•	How to load and explore the dataset and generate ideas for data preparation and model selection.
•	How to fit a final model and use it to predict class labels for specific cases.



This is divided into five parts: 
1.	Adult Income Dataset
2.	Explore the Dataset
3.	Model Test 
4.	Evaluate Model
5.	Make Prediction on New Data
In this project, we use a standard imbalanced machine learning dataset referred to as the “Adult Income” dataset.
